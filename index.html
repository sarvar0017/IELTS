    <H2>Here’s all you need to know about IELTS</H2>
    <P>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the world’s most popular high-stakes English language proficiency test for study, work and migration, with more than three million tests taken in the past year. The IELTS results are recognised by more than 10,000 organisations, including educational institutions, employers, professional associations and governments, in 140 countries around the world.
    <BR>  
        You can choose to take your IELTS test either on paper or computer, depending on your convenience. There is no difference in the content, format or level of difficulty between the two options. Remember, you will have to carefully choose which module you wish to take -  IELTS Academic or IELTS General Training, depending on the purpose of your taking the test. However, to study in the UK, you’ll have to take the IELTS test approved for UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI).</P>
    <H3>IELTS Test Format</H3>
    <p>ELTS is a test of all four language skills: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. You will take the Listening, Reading and Writing tests all on the same day one after the other, with no breaks in between. For the Speaking test, you can book a slot online on your preferred date and time. If you fail to choose a slot within the stated time period, a time slot will be automatically allocated to you. The total test time is under three hours.</p>

   <h2>Why You should take the IELTS Test(5 Reasons)</h2>
   <p>The IELTS test assesses students in four areas: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Interestingly, the test doesn’t have a pass or fail system. You will be ranked on a scale from 0 to 9, 9 being an expert user in English. Depending on the reason for you taking the test (career, living in a foreign country, studying), you will be needing a certain score. In the UK for a general Tier 4 Student Visa, you’ll need to achieve a 5.5 overall and in each of the four areas that you are tested.</p>
   <h3>1 It will help you get into International Universities</h3>
   <p>Having the IELTS qualification brings many opportunities with it. If you’ve been wanting to study at a university in the UK or Ireland, IELTS is just what you need! Many major universities ask for this English language test on their admission requirements, and the score you’ll require depends on which university you’d like to attend. For example, to get into the University of Manchester, you need to have an IELTS score of 6 or above.</p>
   <h3>2 It's great for Your Career</h3>
   <p>Being the world’s most popular English language test, the IELTS qualification is recognised worldwide and accepted by over 10,000 organisations in more than 140 countries. Whether you want to work for a multi-national company, in education or even in government, a good result on your IELTS certificate can help you achieve your career aspirations.</p>
   <h3>3 It's Accurate</h3>
   <p>The IELTS test assesses candidates on listening, speaking, reading and writing and due to the test’s strict nature, you can be assured that your results are a true reflection of your English language abilities.</p>
   <h3>4 It covers American and British English</h3>
   <p>As we know, there are some differences between American and British English and depending on your reasons for taking an English language test, you may need to know one more than the other. Thankfully, the IELTS test covers both American and British English, so no matter what environment you use your English in, the English you learn for your IELTS test will be relevant.</p>
   <h3>5 It's widely available</h3>
   <p>You can take the IELTS in 900 British Council accredited offices around the world, including London and Dublin. But of course, in order to take the test and get the score that you need, a preparation course is essential. The English Studio offers IELTS preparation courses at both our London and Dublin schools to ensure success when it comes to sitting your test.</p>
